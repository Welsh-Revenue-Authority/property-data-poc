## About us

We are a small, multi-disciplinary team in the [Welsh Revenue Authority](https://gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority) made up of product, design, data, and tax policy specialists. We are committed for 12 weeks to explore the opportunities and challenges in this space.

Our specific focus is how we build this on stronger digital and data foundations, for the good of Wales. We hope to bring these ideas to life as a proof of concept - a practical demonstration of some of the things we explore.

We don’t know where this will take us, nor do we expect the answer to be ‘*WRA does it all*’ so we are working in the open and hope to bring the right people together to explore it with us.
