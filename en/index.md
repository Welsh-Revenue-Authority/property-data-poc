The [Welsh Revenue Authority (WRA)](https://gov.wales/welsh-revenue-authority) is responsible for the collection and management of [Land Transaction Tax (LTT)](https://gov.wales/land-transaction-tax-guide) in Wales.

To provide our services, we need to be able to identify land and properties in Wales. To deliver future changes [being consulted on](https://gov.wales/second-homes-local-variation-to-land-transaction-tax-rates) to LTT, and to support the development of other future geographically varied property taxes, we need to be able to identify reliably land and property at a more granular level than we do currently.
We’re exploring how to meet these needs, but at the same time we’ve taken the opportunity to consider if we could create something that might be the foundation for wider uses, for the benefit of Wales.

## About us

We’re a small, multi-disciplinary team hosted by the WRA, made up of product, design, data, and tax policy specialists. We’re committed for 12 weeks to explore the opportunities and challenges in this space.
Our specific focus is how we build on stronger digital and data foundations, for the good of Wales. We hope to bring these ideas to life as a proof of concept - a practical demonstration of some of the things we explore.
We don’t know where this will take us, nor do we expect the answer to be ‘the WRA does it all’ so we’re working in the open and will bring the right people and organisations together to explore it with us.
