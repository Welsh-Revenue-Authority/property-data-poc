So far our prototypes have focused on getting a location or showing a user what data the platform held.

Getting a location is usually the first step in a process. A service needs to determine a location to then be able to do that something else.

Often policies and rules apply to specific geographic regions. Geographic areas can be large, like nations (e.g. in Wales, Land Transaction Tax is paid on property purchases) or small, like wards (e.g. to vote you must go to this polling station). First, you need a location; then you can figure out what geographic policies apply.

With this prototype, we wanted to show how the platform makes building these services easier.
During the Proof of concept phase, the team built the “is it in Wales” service. The team used synthetic data to build the proof-of-concept service. We wanted to prove we could rebuild a similar service using real data we’d already managed to collect for the platform.

We wanted to build something that would determine the users’ location, work out what we know about this location and then cross reference the location with any other data to see what applies to the location.
