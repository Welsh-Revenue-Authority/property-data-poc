Over the course of the last 10 weeks we have been creating prototypes to help us explore the user needs and the technical feasibility of a land and property tax platform.

We have used prototypes to test the platform we are creating, the test assunmptions we've made about the problem space the platform will exist in and to demonstrate what could be possible if a land and property tax platform existed for Wales.

Prototype 1: [Find your local authority](/property-data-poc/en/prototypes/find-your-local-authority)

Prototype 2: [Provide a location journey](/property-data-poc/en/prototypes/provide-a-location-journey)

Prototype 3: [Explore land and property data](/property-data-poc/en/prototypes/explore-land-and-property-data)
