For geographically varied policies a key need is defining the geography or area the policy will apply to.

There are many ways to do this, whether you are starting with a point, a pre-existing geometry or planning on defining your own bespoke one. The policy pattern work from phase 1 explains a few of the approaches.

This prototype tries to show how some of the different approaches that someone could take when defining an area might work.
